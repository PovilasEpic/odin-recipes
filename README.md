# odin-recipes
odin project website recipes "lesson"
THe assignment will include an html file.
Inside of it will be a recipe written on how to make a small, but really good chocolate cake.
I will also include an image to how the end result of how the cake might/should look.

CSS usage will be minimal to none, since the odin project does not include it in the lessons.
I will however use it, if the cake image is too large or to change text size and spacing if it makes the page more comfortable to read.
