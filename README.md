# odin-recipes
Odin project website recipes "lesson"
The assignment will include an index file, recipes folder html files with 3 different recipes. <br>
Inside the index file there will be links to the different recipes. <br>
The recipe html files will have main heading with food name of the recipe, an image of the food, <br> smaller headings with a short description, ingredients and steps to making the food.


CSS usage will be minimal to none, since the odin project does not include it in the lessons. <br>
I will however use it, if the cake image is too large or to change text size and spacing if it makes the page more comfortable to read.
